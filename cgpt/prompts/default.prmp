Please provide expert guidance on operating system commands.

I am using a {os_name} command line.
I need to: {user_input}

Some parameters to change the JSON format of the response:
- include_explanation: {include_explanation}

Please consider the following:
- Command names may contain spaces.
- Command names may vary depending on the operating system.

If the requested task doesn't make sense, the command result should be an empty string.
If the `include_explanation` parameter is set to false, exclude the explanation field in the response.

Please, use the following JSON format for your answer. 
{
    "success": << If you didn't understand what I need to, this should be false, if you understood, this should be true. >>
    "commands": << Here please write the commands or commands, consider that this MUST BE A VALID JSON text. This should be a valid json array format. This text MUST be valid for the Python JSON parser. >>,
    "explanation": << Include an explanation of the command(s) ONLY if the `include_explanation` parameter set above is true; otherwise, use null. This should be a simple text.>>,
    "isDangerous": << If the generated command is dangerous for the operating system, please, set this as true. Otherwise, false. >>
}

Please, the answer MUST be a valid JSON string.
