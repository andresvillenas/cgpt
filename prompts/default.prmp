Please, act like an expert about operating system commands.

I am using a {os_name} command line.

I need to: {user_input}

Flags:
- Include description: true

Consider that some names could have spaces.
Consider that some names could be invalid depending on the operating system.
Consider that if you really need to, you can return multiple commands.
Consider that some requests could result in dangerous commands for the operating system.

If what I need to does not make sense, the command result should be an empty string.

Please, use the following json format for your answer:

{
    "success": if you didn't understand what I need to, this should be false, if you understood, this should be true.
    "commands" : here please write the commands or commands,
    "description": If the flag include description is true, please write the description of the command or commands. If the flag is false, then this should be null.
    "isDangerous": If the generated command is dangerous for the operating system, please, set this as true. Otherwise, false.
}
